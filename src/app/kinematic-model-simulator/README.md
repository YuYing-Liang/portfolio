## Kinematic model generator
This is a web app that generates kinematic models given a certain chassis configuration.

### Features (todo)
- CRUD for chassis
- wheel panel form
- resize wheels
- rotate wheels
- CRUD for wheels
- add rollers (in wheel form)
- rotate rollers (in form, too crowded on canvas)
- rearrange layout: chassis + wheel configuration on the left and the chassis list on the right
- Initial state: create new chassis button --> pop out the form
- lock ratio (for resizing triangular + rectangular chassis)

### Bugs
- not saving sizes in grid units
- labels collide with markers when shape is rotated
- rotator is glitchy
