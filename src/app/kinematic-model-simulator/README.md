## Kinematic model generator
This is a web app that generates kinematic models given a certain chassis configuration.

### Features (todo)
- CRUD for wheels
- lock ratio (for resizing triangular + rectangular chassis)
- create custom hook for localstorage items
- alignment helpers for wheels

### Bugs
- not saving sizes in grid units
- grid snapping not updating immediately for some reason, useLocalStorage() hook??
