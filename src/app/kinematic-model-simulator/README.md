## Kinematic model generator
This is a web app that generates kinematic models given a certain chassis configuration.

### Features (todo)
- CRUD for chassis
- CRUD for wheels
- lock ratio (for resizing triangular + rectangular chassis)
- create custom hook for localstorage items
- alignment helpers for wheels

### Bugs
- not saving sizes in grid units
- labels collide with markers when shape is rotated
- rotator is glitchy
- rotator is in absolute units - issues with wheel editing
